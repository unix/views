## Views Show

Show page views without server.

<br/>

### What is

  - Display page views dynamically now
  - No server required
  - No install required

We identify your unique identity through cache, referer and others, and return a dynamic SVG element.
In addition, `views.show` also provides custom SVG styles, for more information, see the [documentation](https://views.show).

  2. Add `img` to your own page:

For performance and cost reasons， `views.show` can only be displayed **on your own website**,
it can't work in GitHub(README.md) NPM or other places. You can also donate this project to help me do better.
